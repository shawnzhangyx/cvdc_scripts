## This is the code base for the CVDC project
I apologize for the lack of documentation at a lot of places in the scripts. More than half of the directories and scripts were explorative analysis and did not lead to any fruitful ends for us. But feel free to use them for your own analysis if you find them helpful. Basically in every directory, there is a ``master.sh`` file that tells you the order (and information) of the scripts to be run.

I'll try to organize the scripts which can reproduce the figures in our manuscript when it is close to being finalized.
