The scripts for HERV-H KI haplotype-phasing and allelic analysis were maintained by Yunjiang Qiu (serein927@gmail.com); downstream analysis was performed by Luisa Amaral(luisaj.amaral@gmail.com). Because of the complixity of the scripts, only some of the them are listed here. Feel free to e-mail us (especially Yunjiang) if you are interested in the allelic analysis pipeline.
